These are the current requirements for getting your code included in RF24Mesh:

* Try your best to follow the rest of the code, if you're unsure then the NASA C style can help as it's closest to the current style: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950022400.pdf

* Definetly follow PEP-8 if it's Python code.

* Follow the Arduino IDE formatting style for Arduino examples

* Add doxygen-compatible documentation to any new functions you add, or update existing documentation if you change behaviour
